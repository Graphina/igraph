/**
 * \section errorhandlers Error handlers
 *
 * <para>
 * If \a igraph runs into an error - an invalid argument was supplied
 * to a function, or we've ran out of memory - the control is
 * transferred to the \emb error handler \eme function.
 * </para><para>
 * The default error handler is \ref igraph_error_handler_abort which
 * prints an error message and aborts the program.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * The \ref igraph_set_error_handler() function can be used to set a new
 * error handler function of type \ref igraph_error_handler_t, see the
 * documentation of this type for details.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * There are two other predefined error handler functions,
 * \ref igraph_error_handler_ignore and \ref igraph_error_handler_printignore, 
 * these deallocate the temporarily allocated memory (more about this
 * later) and return with the error code. The latter also prints an
 * error message. If you use these error handlers you need to take
 * care about possible errors yourself by checking the return value of
 * every \a igraph function.
 * </para><para>
 * Independently of the error handler installed, all functions in the
 * library do their best to leave their arguments
 * \em semantically unchanged if an error
 * happens. By semantically we mean that the implementation of an
 * object supplied as an argument might change, but its
 * \quote meaning \endquote in most cases does not. The rare occasions
 * when this rule is violated are documented in this manual.
 * </para>
 */

/**
 * \section errorcodes Error codes
 * 
 * <para>Every \a igraph function which can fail return a
 * single integer error code. Some functions are very simple and
 * cannot run into any error, these may return other types, or
 * \type void as well. The error codes are defined by the
 * \ref igraph_i_error_type_t enumeration.
 * </para>
 */

/**
 * \section writing_error_handlers Writing error handlers
 *
 * <para>
 * You can write and install error handlers simply by defining a
 * function of type \ref igraph_error_handler_t and calling
 * \ref igraph_set_error_handler(). This feature is useful for interface
 * writers, as the \a igraph will have the chance to
 * signal errors the appropriate way, eg. the R interface defines an
 * error handler which calls the <function>error()</function>
 * function, as required by R, while the Python interface has an error
 * handler which raises an exception according to the Python way.
 * </para>
 * <para> 
 * If you want to write an error handler, your error handler should
 * call \ref IGRAPH_FINALLY_FREE() to deallocate all temporary memory to
 * prevent memory leaks.
 * </para>
 */

/**
 * \section error_handling_internals Error handling internals
 *
 * <para>
 * If an error happens, the functions in the library call the
 * \ref IGRAPH_ERROR macro with a textual description of the error and an
 * \a igraph error code. This macro calls (through the \ref
 * igraph_error() function) the installed error handler. Another useful
 * macro is \ref IGRAPH_CHECK(), this checks the return value of its
 * argument which is normally a function call, and calls \ref
 * IGRAPH_ERROR if it is not \c IGRAPH_SUCCESS. 
 * </para>
 */

/** 
 * \section deallocating_memory Deallocating memory
 *
 * <para>
 * If a function runs into an error (and the program is not aborted)
 * the error handler should deallocate all temporary memory. This is
 * done by storing the address and the destroy function of all temporary
 * objects in a stack. The \ref IGRAPH_FINALLY function declares an object as
 * temporary by placing its address in the stack. If a function returns
 * with success it calls \ref IGRAPH_FINALLY_CLEAN() with the
 * number of objects to remove from the stack. If an error happens
 * however, the error handler should call \ref IGRAPH_FINALLY_FREE() to
 * deallocate each object added to the stack. This means that the
 * temporary objects allocated in the calling function (and etc.) will
 * be freed as well.
 * </para>
 */

/**
 * \section writing_functions_error_handling Writing \a igraph functions with
 * proper error handling
 *
 * <para>
 * There are some simple rules to keep in order to have functions
 * behaving well in erroneous situations. First, check the arguments
 * of the functions and call \ref IGRAPH_ERROR if they are invalid. Second,
 * call \ref IGRAPH_FINALLY on each dynamically allocated object and call
 * \ref IGRAPH_FINALLY_CLEAN() with the proper argument. Third, use
 * IGRAPH_CHECK on all function calls which can generate errors.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * The size of the stack used for this bookkeeping is fixed, and
 * small. If you want to allocate several objects, write a destroy
 * function which can deallocate all of these. See the
 * <filename>adjlist.c</filename> file in the
 * \a igraph source for an example.
 * </para>
 * <para> 
 * For some functions these mechanisms are simply not flexible
 * enough. These functions should define their own error handlers and
 * restore the error handler before they return.
 * </para>
 */

/**
 * \section error_handling_threads Error handling and threads
 *
 * <para>
 * It is likely that the \a igraph error handling
 * method is \em not thread-safe, mainly because of
 * the static global stack which is used to store the address of the
 * temporarily allocated objects. This issue might be addressed in a
 * later version of \a igraph.
